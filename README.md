# StaffCore
A staff utilities plugin for PocketMine-MP.

This is a plugin I recently coded based on another one I made around ~2019. 

It's originally planned for [Star Network](); but since its release needs to come a long way still, I have decided to release this for it to be useful to someone.
Please note that the plugin is **hardcoded** a *lot* for the reason mentioned above. I might give you support if you customize and use this thing. **I don't have any plans to post this on poggit.**

## Features

* Staff join/leave - Notifies other staff if you join/leave.
* /staffchat - Toggles staff chat: Only staff with it enabled will see what you write in chat.
* /staffmode - Toggles staff mode
  * Freeze: Freezes someone (blocks their movement)
  * Compass: Get through blocks
  * Random Player
  * Vanish: Makes you disappear
* /freeze - Same as staff mode's freeze.
* /vanish - Same as staff mode's vanish.

**Permissions:** StaffCore has a global permission `staffcore.staff` to execute everything.
